{"markdown":"This project includes the NOAA Weather Dataset - JFK Airport (New York) from the Data Asset Exchange and supporting notebooks. The notebooks teach the user to extract, clean and analyze sample weather data and predict weather trends to help airports schedule better flight times. This sample project contains 3 notebooks and 1 CSV file. Please run the notebooks in sequential order of their part numbers using a Python 3.7 runtime.\n\n## Resources:\n\n- Dataset homepage: https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/jfk-weather-data/\n- Dataset download link: https://dax-cdn.cdn.appdomain.cloud/dax-noaa-weather-data-jfk-airport/1.1.4/noaa-weather-data-jfk-airport.tar.gz\n\n## Data assets \n\n- `jfk_weather.csv`: the core dataset as obtained from NOAA.\n\n## Notebooks\n\nOpen the **Assets** tab to access and run the following notebooks in order:\n\n- `Part 1 - Data Cleaning`:  Clean `jfk_weather.csv` and save as `jfk_weather_cleaned.csv`\n- `Part 2 - Data Analysis`:  Read in the cleaned `jfk_weather_cleaned.csv` data file and visualize and analyze the time-series data\n- `Part 3 - Time Series Forecasting`: Explore approaches to predicting future temperatures using the `jfk_weather_cleaned.csv` data file.\n\nYou can review the completed notebooks [here](https://dax-nb-preview-prod.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/preview_notebooks.html?dataset=jfk-weather-data).\n\n## Licenses\n\n- Dataset: [CDLA-Sharing](https://cdla.io/sharing-1-0/)\n- Notebooks:  [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)"}
